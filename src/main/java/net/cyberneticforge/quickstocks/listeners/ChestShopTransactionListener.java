     * TransactionEvent or similar events. Since we don't have ChestShop at compile time,
     * this is left as a framework for when ChestShop is actually present.

     * 1. Check if the shop owner is a company
     * 2. If buying: Check company balance and deduct funds
     * 3. If selling: Add funds to company balance
     * 4. Cancel transaction if insufficient company funds

     * To fully implement ChestShop integration, you would need to:
     * 
     * 1. Add ChestShop as a dependency in pom.xml:
     *    <dependency>
     *        <groupId>com.github.ChestShop-authors</groupId>
     *        <artifactId>ChestShop-3</artifactId>
     *        <version>3.12</version>
     *        <scope>provided</scope>
     *    </dependency>
     * 
     * 2. Listen to these ChestShop events:
     *    - com.Acrobot.ChestShop.Events.TransactionEvent (for buy/sell transactions)
     *    - com.Acrobot.ChestShop.Events.PreTransactionEvent (for validation)
     *    - com.Acrobot.ChestShop.Events.ShopCreatedEvent (already handled in ChestShopListener)
     * 
     * 3. Handle protection events:
     *    - com.Acrobot.ChestShop.Events.Protection.ProtectionCheckEvent
     *    - Check if player has chestshop permission for the company
     * 
     * 4. Integrate with ChestShop's economy:
     *    - Check if shop owner account name matches a company
     *    - Use ChestShopHook methods to manage company balance
     *    - Cancel transactions if company has insufficient funds
