## How Share Pricing Works

- Each company has 10,000 shares
- Share price = Company Balance รท 10,000
- Example: If company has $50,000 balance, each share costs $5.00

## Market Percentage Explained

The market percentage controls how much of the company can be traded:
- **70% (default)**: 7,000 of 10,000 shares can be sold to players
- **50%**: 5,000 of 10,000 shares can be sold to players
- **100%**: All 10,000 shares can be sold (full company value)

This protects the company from being completely bought out unless the owner allows it.

## Buyout Protection

### Enabled (Default)
- Players cannot buy more than 50% of shares
- Owner retains control
- Safer for company owners

### Disabled
- Players can buy majority shares (>50%)
- Majority shareholder automatically becomes new owner and CEO
- All parties are notified
- Riskier but allows full market dynamics

## Important Notes

### For Company Owners
1. **Set a symbol before going public** - Required for market trading
2. **Maintain sufficient balance** - Company needs funds to buy back shares when players sell
3. **CEO protection** - You cannot demote yourself from CEO role
4. **Market requirements**:
   - Only PUBLIC and DAO companies can go on market
   - Minimum balance thresholds apply
   - PRIVATE companies cannot trade shares

### For Investors
1. **Share availability** - Limited by market percentage setting
2. **Buyout protection** - Check if company allows buyouts before investing
3. **Company balance** - Company needs sufficient balance to buy back your shares
4. **Notifications** - Important events are saved for offline players

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Safe Investment
```
Company: TechCorp (PUBLIC)
Balance: $100,000
Market Percentage: 70%
Buyout Protection: Enabled

Share Price: $10.00
Available Shares: 7,000
Max Ownership: 50% (5,000 shares)
```
Investors can buy up to 5,000 shares but cannot take over the company.

### Scenario 2: Buyout Opportunity
```
Company: StartupCo (DAO)
Balance: $50,000
Market Percentage: 100%
Buyout Protection: Disabled

Share Price: $5.00

```
An investor can buy 5,001+ shares to become the new owner!

### Scenario 3: Market Exit
```
Owner: /company market disable TechCorp

Result:
- All shareholders paid out at $10.00/share
- Player with 100 shares receives $1,000
- Company removed from market
- All shareholders notified
```

**"Symbol is already taken"**
- Solution: Choose a different unique symbol

**"Company has insufficient balance to buy back shares"**
- Solution: Company needs more balance to buy back your shares
