## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Comprehensive Tab Completion
Every company command now has intelligent auto-completion:

| `/company create <name> <TAB>` | Company types: PRIVATE, PUBLIC, DAO |
| `/company info <TAB>` | All company names |
| `/company employees <TAB>` | All company names |

| `/company deposit <TAB>` | All company names |
| `/company withdraw <TAB>` | All company names |
| `/company settings <TAB>` | All company names |
| `/company invite <TAB>` | Your company names only |
| `/company invite <company> <TAB>` | Online player names |
| `/company invite <company> <player> <TAB>` | Job titles from that company |
| `/company createjob <TAB>` | Your company names only |
| `/company createjob <company> <title> <TAB>` | Permission suggestions |
| `/company assignjob <TAB>` | Your company names only |
| `/company assignjob <company> <TAB>` | Online player names |
| `/company assignjob <company> <player> <TAB>` | Job titles from that company |

### 2. ✅ Company Settings GUI (`/company settings`)
A beautiful, interactive GUI that shows:

**Header Information:**
- 💰 Company balance (left)
- 👑 Company info: name, type, owner, creation date (center)
- 📋 Your job title and permissions (right)

**Action Buttons (with permission checks):**
- 👥 View Employees - Click to execute `/company employees`
- 📚 View Job Titles - Click to execute `/company jobs`
- 💵 Deposit Funds - Shows command hint
- 💸 Withdraw Funds - Shows command hint (if permitted)
- ✉️ Invite Player - Shows command hint (if permitted)
- 📝 Create Job Title - Shows command hint (if permitted)
- 🎯 Assign Job Title - Shows command hint (if permitted)

**Navigation:**
- 🔄 Refresh - Reload company data
- ❌ Close - Exit the GUI

**Smart Features:**
- Permission-based button visibility
- Hover tooltips with command templates
- Visual permission indicators (✓ checkmarks)
- Color-coded information display

### 3. ✅ Interactive Click Events
All GUI buttons are clickable and either:
- Execute the command directly (for safe actions like viewing employees)
- Show the exact command you need to type (for actions requiring parameters)
- Close the GUI and return you to the game

## Usage Examples

## Benefits

1. **Easier to Use**: No need to remember exact command syntax
2. **Fewer Errors**: Tab completion prevents typos
3. **Better UX**: Visual GUI is more intuitive than text commands
4. **Faster Workflow**: One-click actions for common tasks
5. **Permission-Aware**: Only shows what you can do
6. **Self-Documenting**: Tooltips teach players the commands

## What This Means for Players

Before:
```
Player: "How do I invite someone to my company?"
Admin: "Type /company invite <company> <player> <job>"
Player: "What companies do I have?"
Admin: "Type /company info"
Player: "What jobs are available?"
Admin: "Type /company jobs <company>"
```

After:
```
Player: /company settings <ENTER>
Player: *clicks Invite button*
System: "Use command: /company invite TechCorp <player> <job>"
Player: /company invite TechCorp <TAB>
System: *suggests online players*
Player: /company invite TechCorp Alex <TAB>
System: *suggests job titles: CEO, CFO, EMPLOYEE*
Player: /company invite TechCorp Alex EMPLOYEE <ENTER>
System: ✓ "Invitation sent to Alex"
```

Much simpler and more intuitive! 🎉
