# Company Feature Improvements - Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the company system in QuickStocks.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Tab Completion
Enhanced the `CompanyCommand.onTabComplete()` method to provide intelligent auto-completion for all company-related commands:

#### Main Subcommands (1st argument)
- All subcommands: `create`, `info`, `list`, `invite`, `accept`, `decline`, `invitations`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `employees`, `jobs`, `createjob`, `assignjob`, `settings`

#### Company Types (3rd argument for `create`)
- `PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC`, `DAO`

#### Company Names (2nd argument)
- For `info`, `employees`, `jobs`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `settings`: Shows all companies
- For `invite`, `createjob`, `assignjob`: Shows only companies where the player is an employee

#### Player Names
- For `invite` (3rd argument): Shows online players
- For `assignjob` (3rd argument): Shows online players

#### Job Titles
- For `invite` (4th argument): Shows job titles from the specified company
- For `assignjob` (4th argument): Shows job titles from the specified company

#### Permission Suggestions (4th argument for `createjob`)
- Common permission combinations: `invite`, `createjobs`, `withdraw`, `manage`, and combinations

### 2. Company Settings GUI (`/company settings [company]`)
Created a new interactive GUI for managing company settings:

#### GUI Features:
- **Company Information Display** (Top center)
  - Company name, type, balance, owner, creation date
  
- **Player's Job Information** (Top right)
  - Current job title
  - Permission list with visual indicators (✓ for granted permissions)

- **Balance Display** (Top left)
  - Current company balance with instructions

- **Action Buttons** (Middle section)
  - **View Employees** - Execute `/company employees` command
  - **View Job Titles** - Execute `/company jobs` command
  - **Deposit Funds** - Show command hint
  - **Withdraw Funds** - Show command hint (only if player has permission)
  - **Invite Player** - Show command hint (only if player has permission)
  - **Create Job Title** - Show command hint (only if player has permission)
  - **Assign Job Title** - Show command hint (only if player has permission)

- **Navigation Buttons** (Bottom)
  - **Refresh** - Reload company data
  - **Close** - Close the GUI

#### Button Tooltips:
All action buttons include:
- Gray description of the action
- Yellow command template showing the exact command to use

### 3. GUI Listener
Created `CompanySettingsGUIListener` to handle all GUI interactions:
- Prevents item pickup/movement in the GUI
- Handles button clicks for each action
- Executes commands or shows command hints as appropriate
- Manages GUI refresh functionality

## Implementation Details

### File Changes

#### New Files:
1. `src/main/java/com/example/quickstocks/gui/CompanySettingsGUI.java`
   - Main GUI class implementing `InventoryHolder`
   - Manages GUI layout and refresh logic
   - Uses Material icons for visual appeal

2. `src/main/java/com/example/quickstocks/listeners/CompanySettingsGUIListener.java`
   - Event listener for GUI interactions
   - Routes button clicks to appropriate handlers

#### Modified Files:
1. `src/main/java/com/example/quickstocks/commands/CompanyCommand.java`
   - Added comprehensive tab completion logic
   - Added `handleSettings()` method for opening the GUI
   - Added "settings" case to the subcommand switch
   - Updated help message to include settings command
   - Added helper methods for tab completion: `getCompanyNames()`, `getPlayerCompanyNames()`, `getJobTitles()`, `getOnlinePlayerNames()`

2. `src/main/java/com/example/quickstocks/QuickStocksPlugin.java`
   - Added import for `CompanySettingsGUIListener`
   - Registered the new listener in `registerListeners()` method

3. `src/main/java/com/example/quickstocks/infrastructure/db/MigrationRunner.java`
   - Fixed syntax error (missing comma in migration file array)

## Usage Examples

### Opening the Settings GUI:
```
/company settings                    # Opens settings for your first company
/company settings MyCompany          # Opens settings for a specific company
```

### Tab Completion Examples:
```
/company cr<TAB>           → /company create
/company create MyCo <TAB> → PRIVATE, PUBLIC, DAO suggestions
/company invite MyCo <TAB> → Online player names
/company invite MyCo John <TAB> → Job titles from MyCo
```

## Permission Checks
The GUI respects company permissions:
- **Withdraw button**: Only shown if player has `canWithdraw` permission
- **Invite button**: Only shown if player has `canInvite` permission
- **Create Job button**: Only shown if player has `canCreateTitles` permission
- **Assign Job button**: Only shown if player has `canManageCompany` permission

## Design Patterns Used
1. **Holder Pattern**: GUI implements `InventoryHolder` for type-safe inventory management
2. **Service Layer**: Uses `CompanyService` for all business logic
3. **Immutable Models**: Company model is immutable; GUI refreshes by replacing the object
4. **Event-Driven**: Listener pattern for GUI interactions

## Future Enhancements
Possible improvements for the future:
1. Add pagination for companies with many employees
2. Add confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions
3. Add real-time balance updates
4. Add transaction history view
5. Add employee management directly in the GUI
6. Add customizable GUI themes
