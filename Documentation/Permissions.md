## üìù Permission Best Practices

### For Server Owners

1. **Keep crypto creation restricted** - Only give to trusted players or make it a donator perk
2. **Limit wallet commands** - Only admins should manipulate wallets
3. **Allow company features** - Most players should be able to create and manage companies
4. **Market devices are optional** - Decide if this should be a special item or craftable
5. **Audit is admin-only** - Only operators should access database repair tools

### For Players

1. **Understand your permissions** - Use `/crypto create` to check if you can create crypto
2. **Request permissions** - Ask admins if you need access to specific features
3. **Company roles matter** - Your job title determines what you can do in a company
4. **No permission for trading** - Anyone can trade on the market without special permissions

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "You don't have permission..."

**For crypto creation:**
- Verify you have `maksy.stocks.crypto.create` permission
- Ask your server administrator to grant this permission

**For wallet commands:**
- These are admin-only commands
- You need `quickstocks.wallet.add` or `quickstocks.wallet.set` permission
- Contact a server operator

**For company management:**
- Check you're actually an employee of the company
- Verify your job title has the required permissions (`/company jobs <company>`)
- Company-specific permissions are separate from Minecraft permissions

### Permission not working?

1. **Check your permission plugin** - Ensure LuckPerms/PermissionsEx/GroupManager is installed
2. **Verify permission syntax** - Copy exact permission nodes from this page
3. **Restart or reload** - Try `/lp reloadconfig` or restart the server
4. **Check inheritance** - Make sure permission groups are inheriting correctly
5. **Test as op** - Temporarily op yourself to verify the feature works
